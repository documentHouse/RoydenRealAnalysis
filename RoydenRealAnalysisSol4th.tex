Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are two sets in $\mathcal{A}$ with $A \subseteq B$, then $m(A) \le m(B)$. This property is called \emph{monotonicity}.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

Let $B' = B \sim A$ so that $B = B' \cap A = \emptyset$ by the construction of the set $B'$. Since $A \subseteq B$ we have that $B = B' \cup A$. Because $A$ and $B'$ are disjoint we use the countable additivity of the measure and that $m(E) \ge 0$ for all $E$ (because we are given that $m: \mathcal{A} \to [0,\infty]$)to derive:
\begin{eqnarray*}
m(B) &=& m(A \cup B') = m(A) + m(B') \\
        &&\hspace{53px}\ge m(A)
\end{eqnarray*}

Prove that if there is a set $A$ in the collection $\mathcal{A}$ for which $m(A) < \infty$, then $m(\emptyset) = 0$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

Let $A$ have finite measure. Note that since $A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$ that $A$ and $\emptyset$ are disjoint. We may then apply countable additivity to show:
\begin{equation*}
m(A) = m(A \cup \emptyset) = m(A) + m(\emptyset) \implies m(\emptyset) = 0
\end{equation*}

Let $\{ E_k \}^\infty_{k = 1}$ be a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal{A}$. Prove that $m(\cup^\infty_{k=1} E_k) \le \sum^\infty_{k = 1} m(E_k)$
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

First we show  $m(\cup^n_{k=1} E_k) \le \sum^n_{k = 1} m(E_k)$ by induction.\\
Let $n = 2$ so that we first want to show $m(A \cup B) \le m(A) + m(B)$. Let $O = A \cap B$ and let $A' = A \sim O$ and $B' = B \sim O$. It is clear from construction that we have
\begin{align}
&A \cup B = A' \cup O \cup B' \label{unionbreak} \\
&A = A' \cup O \hspace{15px} \text{and} \hspace{15px} B = B' \cup O \label{intersum} \\
&(A' \cap O) \cap B' = \emptyset \label{uniondisjoint} \\
&A' \subset A \hspace{15px} \text{and} \hspace{15px} B' \subset B \label{partsubs}
\end{align}

\noindent We may use the countable additivity of $m$ to derive:
\begin{eqnarray*}
m(A \cup B) = m(A' \cup O \cup B') &=& m(A' \cup O) + m(B') \hspace{20px} \text{By $(\ref{unionbreak})$ and $(\ref{uniondisjoint})$} \\		  
 &=&  m(A) + m(B') \hspace{20px} \text{By $(\ref{intersum})$} \\
 &\le&  m(A) + m(B') \hspace{20px} \text{By $(\ref{partsubs}$) and the monotonocity shown in the previous problem}
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent Now we show the induction step.
\begin{eqnarray*}
m(\cup^{n+1}_{k=1} E_k) &=& m((\cup^n_{k=1} E_k) \cup E_{n+1}) \\
&\le& m(\cup^n_{k=1} E_k) + m(E_{n+1}) \hspace{73px} \text{By the induction base} \\
&\le&  \sum^n_{k = 1} m(E_k) + m(E_{n+1}) =  \sum^{n+1}_{k = 1} m(E_k) \hspace{15px} \text{By the induction step} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

So we have to show that $m(\cup^n_{k=1} E_k) \le \sum^n_{k = 1} m(E_k)$. Since for all $E$ we have $0 \le m( E)$ it is true for all $n$ that
\[ \sum^n_{k=1} m(E_k) \le \sum^\infty_{k = 1} m(E_k) \]
By the previous result we have 
\[ m(\cup^{n}_{k=1} E_k) \le \sum^n_{k=1} m(E_k) \le \sum^\infty_{k = 1} m(E_k) \implies m(\cup^{n}_{k=1} E_k) \le \sum^\infty_{k = 1} m(E_k)\]
Since this expression is independent of $n$ we make take the limit to get 
\[\lim_{n \to \infty} m(\cup^{n}_{k=1} E_k) = m(\cup^{\infty}_{k=1} E_k) \le \sum^\infty_{k = 1} m(E_k) \]

A set function $c$, defined on all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, is defined as follows. Define $c(E)$ to be $\infty$ if $E$ has infinityle many members and $c(E)$ to be equal to the number of elements in $E$ if $E$ is finite; define $c(\emptyset) = 0$. Show that $c$ is a countable additive and translation invariant set function. This set function is called the \textbf{counting measure}.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

We first show the translation invariance of $c$. \\
First we note that the translation of $\emptyset$ by $y \in \mathbb{R}$ is still $\emptyset$ so $c(\emptyset + y) = c(\emptyset) = 0$. Now let $f$ be a function such that $f: E \to E + y$ defined as follows. If $x \in E$ then $f$ takes $x \to x + y \in E + y$. This function is clearly bijective so $E$ and $E + y$ have the same 'number' of elements. That is, finite sets are taken to finite sets and infinite sets are taken to infinite sets. This means that $c(E) = c(E + y)$ which finishes the translation invariance of $c$.\\
\indent Now we show the countable additivity of $c$.
We consider $\{ E_k \}^\infty_{k = 1}$, a disjoint countable collection of sets.\\
If any of the sets $E_k$ is infinite then the relationship 
\begin{equation}
c(\cup^\infty_{k = 1} E_k) = \sum^\infty_{k = 1} c(E_k) \label{countingmeas-ca}
\end{equation}
 is trivially true. We now assume that all $E_k$ are finite.\\
\indent First we assume that there are infinitly many $E_k$ that are non-empty and we drop the empty sets from the equation since they don't contribute to the union or the sum in (\ref{countingmeas-ca}).
Since there are an infinite number of $E_k$, all of which are disjoint, we have $c(\cup^\infty_{k = 1} E_k) = \infty$. This is so because we may choose a member from each $E_k$ which is distinct from the other members of the sets. We can do this for each $k$ so we form a new set $E'$ which is the union of these elements and is 1 to 1 correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$. This is a subset of $(\cup^\infty_{k = 1} E_k$ so we have the state counting measure.\\
\indent Also, because we know there are an infinity of $E_k$ which are nonempty we know that $1 \le c(E_k) \implies \infty \le c(\sum_{k = 1}^\infty E_k) \implies c(\sum_{k = 1}^\infty E_k) = \infty $. This once again gives the relation in (\ref{countingmeas-ca}).\\
The case of a finite number of disjoint $E_k$ is a simple induction and proof is complete.

By using the properties of outer measure, prove that the interval $[0,1]$ is not countable.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

As was shown in the text, the outer measure of countable sets is 0. One of the properties of outer measure is that the outer measure of an interval is its length. Since $m^*([0,1])= 1 \neq 0$ the assumption that $[0,1]$ is countable leads to a contradiction.

\begin{flushleft} 
Problem 6 - Section 2.2, page 34\\
\rule{500pt}{1pt}\\
\end{flushleft} 

Let $A$ be the set of irrational numbers in the interval $[0,1]$. Prove that $m^*(A) = 1$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

Let $\mathbb{Q}' = [0,1] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ and  $A = [0,1] \cap \mathbb{I}$ where $\mathbb{Q}$ are the rational numbers in $\mathbb{R}$. We note that $[0,1] = \mathbb{Q}' \cup A$ and $\mathbb{Q}' \cap A = \emptyset$.

First, $A' \subset [0,1]$ so we have 
\[ m^*(A) \le m^*([0,1]) = 1\] 
by monotonocity. On the other hand we have 
\[1 = m^*([0,1]) = m^*(\mathbb{Q}' \cup A) \le  m^*(A) +  m^*(\mathbb{Q}')  =  m^*(A)\]
since $\mathbb{Q}'$ is a subset of the rationals which have measure zero.
So we have both $ m^*(A) \le 1$ and $1 \le m^*(A)$  which implies $m^*(A) = 1$.

\begin{flushleft} 
Problem 7 - Section 2.2, page 34\\
\rule{500pt}{1pt}\\
\end{flushleft} 

A set of real numbers is said to be a $G_\delta$ set provided it is the intersection of a countable collection of open sets. Show that for any bounded set $E$, there is a $G_\delta$ set $G$ for which 
\[ E \subset G \; \text{and} \; m^*(G) = m^*(E) \]
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

The outer measure $m^*(E)$ is defined as the infimum of the sums $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \ell(I_k)$ where the $I_k$ are intervals covering the set $E$. This means that for each $k$ we can chose a collection of open intervals $I_j$ such that  $m^*(E) \le \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \ell(I_j) \le m^*(E) + 1/2^k$ from the definition of the infimum.\\
\indent Since the $I_j$ are open we can construct a set for each $k$ as $G_k = \cup_j I_j$ which is open since it is a union of open sets. We also know that $E \subset G_k$ for all $k$ because $G_k$ is the open cover formed by the intervals $I_j$. \\
\indent We now form the set $G = \cap_{k=1} G_k$. From the fact that $E \subset G_k$ for all $k$ we immediately get that $E \subset G$.\\
\indent We also take advantage of the property that $A \cap B \subset A$ and $A \cap B \subset B$ to note $G = \cap_{k=1} G_k \subset G_k$ for all $k$. \\
This allows us to derive the final property for the proof
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&m*(E) \le m^*(G) \le m^*(G_k) =  \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \ell(I_j) \le m^*(E) + 1/2^k\\
&& \implies m^*(E) \le m^*(G) \le m^*(E) + 1/2^k \, \text{for all $k$} \\
&& \implies m^*(E) = m^*(G)\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{flushleft} 

Let $B$ be the set of rational numbers in the interval [0,1], and let $\{ I_k \}^n_{k=1}$ be a finite collection of open intervals that covers $B$. Prove that $\sum^n_{k=1} m^*(I_k) \ge 1$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

It is true that if $\overline{B}$ is the closure of $B$ and $ B \subset C = \cup_{k = 1}^n I_k$ then $\overline{B} \subset \overline{C}$. We also know that $\overline{ \cup_{k = 1}^n I_k} = \cup_{k = 1}^n \overline{I_k}$ which in this case means the open intervals $I_k$ become closed intervals $\overline{I_k}$. Since $\overline{B} = [0,1]$ we have that the closed intervals $\{\overline{I_k}\}$ cover $[0,1]$.\\
\indent The open and closed intervals of the same length have the same the outer measure so this allows us to show:
\[ \sum_{k = 1}^n m^*(I_k) =  \sum_{k = 1}^n m^*(\overline{I_k}) \ge m^*(\cup_{k = 1}^n \overline{I_k}) \ge m^*([0,1]) = 1 \]

\rule{500pt}{1pt}\\
\end{flushleft} 

Prove that if $m^*(A) = 0$, then $m^*(A \cup B) = m^*(B)$
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

From the fact that $B \subset A \cup B$ we have from monotonocity that $m^*(B) \le m^*(A \cup B)$. We also have by countable subadditivity that $m^*(A \cup B) \le m^*(A) + m^*(B) = m^*(B)$. These two relationships give $m^*(B) = m^*(A \cup B)$.

\begin{flushleft} 
Problem 10 - Section 2.2, page 34\\

\end{flushleft} 

Let $A$ and $B$ be bounded sets for which there is an $\alpha > 0$ such that $|a - b| \ge \alpha$ for all $a \in A, b \in B$. Prove that $m^*(A \cup B) = m^*(A) + m ^*(B)$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

By countable additivity we know that $m^*(A \cup B) \le m^*(A) + m^*(B)$ so it only remains to show that $m^*(A \cup B) \ge m^*(A) + m^*(B)$.

\begin{flushleft}

\end{flushleft} 

Prove that if a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ contains intervals of the form $(a,\infty)$, then it contains all intervals.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

We make take the complement of $(a,\infty)$ with respect to $\mathbb{R}$, since we have a $\sigma$-algebra, to get all intervals of the form $(-\infty, b]$.\\
We may then also derive the following intervals because countable unions and intersections are again in the $\sigma$-algebra.

\begin{eqnarray*}
(-\infty, b) &=& \cup_{k = 1}^\infty (-\infty, b - \frac{1}{n}] \\
\left[a, \infty \right) &=& \cap_{k = 1}^\infty (a - \frac{1}{n}, \infty]
\end{eqnarray*}

We may now derive the final intervals as follows, again appealing to the fact that we are in a $\sigma$-algebra.

\begin{eqnarray*}
(a, b) &=& (a, \infty) \cap (-\infty, b) \\
(a, b] &=& (a, \infty) \cap (-\infty, b] \\
\left[a, b\right) &=& [a, \infty) \cap (-\infty, b) \\
\left[a, b\right] &=& [a, \infty) \cap (-\infty, b] \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Show that every interval is a Borel set.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

The Borel set is the $\sigma$ algebra that contains all the open sets. Since $(a, \infty)$ is an open set the result of Problem 11 shows that the Borel sets contain all intervals.

\begin{flushleft} 
Problem 13 - Section 2.3, page 40\\
\rule{500pt}{1pt}\\
\end{flushleft} 

Show that (i) the translate of an $F_\sigma$ set is also $F_\sigma$, (ii) the translate of a $G_\delta$ set is also $G_\delta$ , and (iii) the translate of a set of measure zero also has measure zero.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

We start by showing that the translate of an open set is open. We note first that the translate of open interval $(a,b)$ is $(a + y, b + y)$ which is still an open interval. An open set is a countable union of open intervals so we know that 
\[ O = \cup^\infty_{n = 1}(a_n, b_n) \implies  O + y = \cup^\infty_{n = 1}(a_n + y, b_n + y)  \]

Since each of the intervals $(a_n + y, b_n + y)$ is open by the previous comment we have $O +  y$ as a countable union of open sets which is open.\\
\indent We also need to show that the translation of a closed set is also closed. We do this by first noting that if $C$ is a closed set and the complement of $C$ in $\mathbb{R}$ is $C'$ then we have the following relationship $C' + y = (C + y)'$ since
\[ x \in C' + y \iff x - y \in C' \iff x- y \notin C \iff x \notin C + y \iff x \in (C + y)' \] \\
Now since $C$ is closed we know that $C'$ is open. We form the translate and use the previous relationship to note that since $C' + y = (C + y)'$ that $(C + y)'$ must be open. This means that $C+y$ must be closed so we have shown that 
\[ C \; \text{is closed} \implies C + y \; \text{is also closed} \]


\noindent We can solve the parts of the problem:\\

\noindent (i) Let $F \in F_\sigma$ so that $F = \cup^\infty_{n = 1} C_n$ where $C_n$ are closed sets. We know that $F + y = \cup^\infty_{n = 1} C_n + y$ and by the previous comments each of the $C_n + y$ is closed so $F + y$ is a countable intersection of closed sets therefore $F + y \in F_\sigma$\\

\noindent (ii) Similarly, let $G \in G_\delta$ so that $G = \cap^\infty_{n = 1} O_n$ where $O_n$ are open sets. We know that $G + y = \cap^\infty_{n = 1} O_n + y$ and by the previous comments each of the $O_n + y$ is open so $G + y$ is a countable union of open sets therefore $G + y \in G_\delta$\\

\noindent (iii) We first note that by hypothesis the measurable set $E$ is such that $m^*(E) = 0$. By proposition 10 we know that the translate of a measurable set is measurable. By the translation invariance of measure we also know that $m^*(E  +y) = m^*(E) = 0$.

\begin{flushleft} 
Problem 14 - Section 2.3, page 40\\
\rule{500pt}{1pt}\\
\end{flushleft} 

Show that if a set $E$ has positive outer measure, then there is a bounded subset of $E$ that also has positive outer measure.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}
 
Let $I_n$ be the interval $[n, n + 1] $,  then it is the case that $E = \cup_{n = 1} ^\infty  E\cap I_n $.  From the property of countable subadditivity we have that $0 \le m^*(E) \le \sum_{n  = 1}^\infty m^*(E\cap I_n)$ which shows that one of the intersections of $E$ with $I_n$ must have a positive value. \\
\indent If this were not the case then the outer measure of all of the intersections of $E$ with the intervals would be zero. By the earlier statement that $0 \le m^*(E) \le \sum_{n  = 1}^\infty m^*(E\cap I_n)$ this would imply that the outer measure of $E$ is zero contrary to our assumption. Therefore one of the intersections with the intervals $I_n$ must have a positive outer measure.

\begin{flushleft}

\end{flushleft} 

Show that if $E$ has finite measure and $\epsilon > 0$, then $E$ is the disjoint union of a finite number of measurable sets, each of which as measure at most $\epsilon$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

It must be the case that there exists an $M$ such that $m^*(E \sim [-M, M]) \le \epsilon$.  This is to say there must be a bounded interval $[-M, M]$ that contains all but $\epsilon$ of the set $E$. If this were not the case then we have  $m^*(E \sim [-M, M]) > \epsilon$ for all $M$ which says that $E$ does not have finite measure. If we let $S = E \sim [-M, M]$ then $m^*(S) \le \epsilon$.\\
\indent We now break up $[-M, M]$ into sets of size at most $\epsilon$ based on the following pattern:

\begin{eqnarray*}
S_1 &=& [-M, -M + \epsilon)\\
S_2 &=& [-M + \epsilon, -M + 2 \epsilon)\\
S_3 &=& [-M + 2 \epsilon, -M + 3 \epsilon]\\
\ldots&&
\end{eqnarray*}

\indent Since we have $S \cup S_1 \cup S_2 \cdots = \mathbb{R}$ we know that $E$ is a subset of this union each of whose elements are disjoint and of outer measure less than or equal to $\epsilon$. The disjoint union we are looking for is therefore
\[ E = (E \cap S) \cup (E \cap S_1) \cup (E \cap S_2) \cdots \]

Show that a set $E$ is measurable if and only if for each $\epsilon > 0$,  there is a closed set $F$ and open set $O$ for which $F \subset E \subset O$  and $m^*(O \sim F) < \epsilon$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

We first assume that $E$ is measurable. By Theorem 11 $(i)$ for each $\epsilon$ there is a open set $O$ containing $E$ such that $m^*(O \sim E) < \epsilon / 2$. Also, by Theorem 11 $(iii)$ for each $\epsilon$ there is a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ such that $m^*(E \sim F) < \epsilon / 2$. Using the excision property of measurable sets below gives the first part of the theorem:
\[ m^*(O \sim F) = m^*(O) - m^*(F) =  m^*(O) - m^*(E) + m^*(E) - m^*(F)  =  m^*(O \sim E) + m^*(E \sim F) < \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon  \]

Now we assume there is a closed set $F$ and open set $O$ for which $F \subset E \subset O$  and $m^*(O \sim F) < \epsilon$. Since $F \subset E \subset O$ we have $ \emptyset \subset E \sim F \subset O \sim F$. So by monotonicity we have $m^*(E \sim F) \le m^*(O \sim F)$ which implies by the hypothesis $m^*(O \sim F) < \epsilon$ that $m^*(E \sim F) < \epsilon$. So by Theorem 11 part $(iii)$ that $E$ is measurable.

\noindent \emph{Corrected Problem statement from errata}:\\
\indent Let $E$ have finite outer measure. Show that there is a $G_\sigma$ set $G$ for which $E \subset G$ and $m^*(E) = m^*(G)$. Use this to show that $E$ is measurable if and only if there is an $F_\sigma$ set, $F$, for which $F \subset E$ and $m^*(F) = m^*(E)$.
\\ \emph{Proof.}

The first part of the implication, that $E$ is measurable implies that there is a $F \in F_\sigma$ such that $m^*(F) = m^*(E)$, is straight forward. Since $E$ is measurable we know from theorem 11 part $(iv)$ that there exists an $F \in F_\sigma$ such that $m^*(E \sim F) = 0$. By the excision property we get 
\begin{equation}  
m^*(E) - m^*(F) = m^*(E \sim F) = 0 \implies m^*(E) = m^*(F) \label{openbound}
\end{equation}


We now need to show that if there exists an $F \in F_\sigma$ such that $m^*(E \sim F) = 0$ and a $G \in G_\sigma$ for which $E \subset G$ and $m^*(E) = m^*(G)$ then E is measurable. First we show that there is a $G \in G_\sigma$ such that $m^*(E) = m^*(G)$. By the definition of outer measure we have for each $k$ that
\[ \sum^\infty \ell(I_j) \le m^*(E) + \frac{1}{k} \]
where $I_k$ are open intervals. If we let the $O_k = \cup \ell(I_j)$ for each $k$ then because each $O_k$ is open we may form $G = \cap O_k$. By $(\ref{openbound})$ we have for every $k$ that
\[ 0 \le m^*(G) \le m^*(E) + \frac{1}{k} \implies m^*(G) - m^*(E) < \frac{1}{k} \]
Taking the limit gives us that $0 \le m^*(G) - m^*(E) \le 0 \implies m^*(G) = m^*(E)$. We can now finish the proof by taking this result along with there existing a $F \subset E$ such that $m^*(F) = m^*(E)$ to show the measurability of $E$.
Since $F$ is measurable by the excision property we have
\[ m^*(G \sim F) = m^*(G) - m^*(F) = m^*(G) - m^*(E) + m^*(E) - m^*(F) = 0 \]
Also, because $F \subset E \subset G$ we have $E \sim F \subset G \sim F$. By monotonicity we have 
\[ 0 \le m^*(E \sim F) \le m^*(G \sim F) = 0  \implies m^*(E \sim F) = 0\] 
We may write $E = F \cup E \sim F$. Since $E \sim F$ has measure zero it is measurable and $F \in F_\delta$ so $F$ is measurable as well. Because the set of measurable sets is a $\sigma$-algebra the union of the two measurable sets $F$ and $E \sim F$ is also a measurable set so $E$ is measurable.

Let $E$ have finite outer measure. Show that if $E$ is not measurable, then there is an open set $O$ containing $E$ that has finite outer measure and for which 
\[ m^*(O \sim E) > m^*(O) - m^*(E) \]
\\ \emph{Proof 1.}

It was shown in the beginning of the section that if $E$ is measurable then $m^*(O \sim E) = m^*(O) - m^*(E)$. Given the hypothesis that $E$ is not measurable we must have
\begin{eqnarray}
&&m^*(O \sim E) > m^*(O) - m^*(E) \hspace{8px} \text{or ...} \label{measurediffgreat}\\
&&m^*(O \sim E) < m^*(O) - m^*(E) \label{measurediffless}
\end{eqnarray}

Now, since $E \subset O$ we have $O = O \sim E \cup E$ so we may derive 
\[ m^*(O) =  m^*(O \sim E \cup E) \le m^*(O \sim E) + m^*(E)  \]
This contradicts the possibility of $(\ref{measurediffless})$ which gives only the possibility of $(\ref{measurediffgreat})$, this completes the proof.\\

\emph{Proof 2.}

We prove the contrapositive that if all open sets $O$ containing $E$ are such that\\ $m^*(O \sim E) \le m^*(O) - m^*(E)$ then $E$ is measurable.\\
We know that $E$ has finite measure so for each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists a set of open intervals $I_n$ such that 
\[ \sum^\infty \ell(I_n) < m^*(E) + \epsilon\]

\noindent If we now let $O = \cup^\infty I_n$ then we know that $m^*(O) \le \sum^\infty \ell(I_n)$ since 
\[ m^*(O) = m^*(  \cup^\infty I_n ) \le \sum^\infty m^*(I_n) = \sum^\infty \ell(I_n)  \]

\noindent We may now derive the following:
\[ m^*(O) \le \sum^\infty \ell(I_n) < m^*(E) + \epsilon \implies m^*(O) - m^*(E) < \epsilon \]

\noindent so we have shown for each $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an open set $O$ which contains $E$ such that 
\[ m^*(O) - m^*(E) < \epsilon \implies m^*(O \sim E) < \epsilon\]

\noindent By Theorem 11 $(i)$ this shows that $E$ is measurable. This completes the proof.

(Lebesgue) Let $E$ have finite outer measure. Show that $E$ is measurable if and only if for each open, bounded interval $(a,b)$,
\[ b - a =  \ m^*((a,b) \cap E) + m^*((a,b) \sim E). \]
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

First we show that if $E$ is measurable then we have the expression above. This is straightforward because  by the definition of measurability we have

\[  m^*(A) = m^*(A \cap E) + m^*(A \cap E^C) \]

\noindent Since it is true that $A \sim E = A \cap E^C$ we have

\[  m^*(A) = m^*(A \cap E) + m^*(A \sim E) \]

\noindent Finally we substitute $A = (a,b)$ and we note from a previous proposition that $m^*((a,b)) = b - a$ to get:

\begin{equation} 
b - a =  m^*((a,b) \cap E) + m^*((a,b) \sim E). \label{intervalmeasure} 
\end{equation}

Now we show that $b - a =  m^*((a,b) \cap E) + m^*((a,b) \sim E)$ implies the measurability of $E$. By Theorem 11 this is equivalent to showing that for each $\epsilon > 0$,  there is an open set $O$ containing $E$ for which $m^*(O \sim E) < \epsilon$.\\

Because $E$ has finite outer measure there exists, for every $\epsilon > 0$, a set of intervals $I_n = (a_n, b_n)$ that cover $E$ such that 
\begin{equation} 
\sum^\infty m^*(I_n)  \le \epsilon  + m^*(E) \label{finitemeasurebound} 
\end{equation}

Now let $O = \cup^\infty I_n$ and perform the following algebra:

\begin{eqnarray}
m^*(O \sim E) = m^*((\cup^\infty I_n) \sim E) &=& m^*(\cup^\infty (I_n \sim E))  \nonumber \\
&\le& \sum^\infty m^*(I_n \sim E) \hspace{15px} \text{from countable subadditivity} \nonumber \\
&\le& \sum^\infty (m^*(I_n) -  m^*(I_n \cap E)) \hspace{15px} \text{from (\ref{intervalmeasure}) since $I_n = (a_n, b_n)$} \nonumber \\
&\le& \sum^\infty m^*(I_n) -  \sum^\infty m^*(I_n \cap E) \hspace{15px} \label{riemannrearr}
\end{eqnarray}

The last step comes from the fact that $E$ is of finite measure,  $\sum^\infty m^*(I_n)$ differs from $E$ by at most $\epsilon$ and that the outer measure is positive definite. These facts allow us to use Riemanns theorem on rearrangement to produce the sum in $(\ref{riemannrearr})$.\\
We now show
\begin{eqnarray*} 
&&m^*(O \cap E) =  m^*(\cup^\infty I_n \cap E) \le \sum^\infty  m^*(I_n \cap E) \; \text{by countable subadditivity}\\
&&\implies \sum^\infty m^*(I_n) -  \sum^\infty  m^*(I_n \cap E) \le \sum^\infty m^*(I_n) - m^*(O \cap E) 
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent Applying the above inequality to the inequality derived in $(\ref{riemannrearr})$ gives

\begin{eqnarray*}
m^*(O \sim E) \le m^*(I_n) -  \sum^\infty m^*(I_n \cap E) &\le& \sum^\infty m^*(I_n) - m^*(O \cap E) \\
&\le& \sum^\infty m^*(I_n) - m^*(E) \; \text{since $E \subset O$} \\
&\le& \epsilon \; \text{by $(\ref{finitemeasurebound})$}
\end{eqnarray*}

Use property $(ii)$ of Theorem 11 as the primitive definition of a measurable set and prove that the union of two measurable sets is measurable. Then do the same for property $(iv)$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

The proof for $(ii)$ has two parts with the proof for $(iv)$ being analogous. We are told we need to prove that the union of two sets $E$ and $E'$ is measurable given that each set is measurable individually. We need to do this using $(ii)$ of theorem so, explicitly we need to prove that given $E$ and $E'$ are measurable as defined by $(ii)$ we need to show that:\\
\indent There is a $G_\delta$ set $G''$ containing $E \cup E'$ for which $m^*(G \sim E \cup E') = 0$. \\

\noindent We will show that if $G$ satisfies $(ii)$ for $E$ and $G'$ satisfies $(ii)$ for $E'$ then $G'' = G \cup G'$ is the set we are looking for.

The first part of the proof is showing that $m^*(G \cup G \sim E \cup E') = 0$. To do this we note that $(G \cup G \sim E \cup E') \subset (G \sim E \cup G' \sim E')$. We can quickly show this by taking $x \in G \cup G \sim E \cup E'$ which means that $x \in G$ or $x \in G'$ but $x \notin E$ and $x \notin E'$. If $x \in G$ then $x \in G \sim E$ and so $x \in G \sim E \cup G' \sim E'$. If on the other hand if $x \in G'$ then $x \in G' \sim E'$ so $x \in G \sim E \cup G' \sim E'$. This shows that $x$ must be in $G \sim E \cup G' \sim E'$ so the stated relation holds.
We may now use monotonicity and then countable subadditivity to finish the first part of the proof:
\[  0 \le m^*(G \cup G \sim E \cup E') \le m^*(G \sim E \cup G' \sim E') \le m^*(G \sim E) + m^*(G' \sim E') = 0  \]
This shows that $m^*(G \cup G \sim E \cup E') = 0$.  The second part of the proof is showing that if $G \in G_\delta$ and $G' \in G_\delta$ then $G \cup G' \in G_\delta$.

Show that if $E1$ and $E2$ are measurable, then
\[ m(E_1 \cup E_2) + m(E_1 \cap E_2) = m(E_1) + m(E_2) \]
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

We may break the union $E_1 \cup E_2$ into three pieces. The part which is only in $E_1$ which is $E_1 \cap E_2^c$, the part which is only in $E_2$ which is $E_2 \cap E_1^c$, and the part that $E_1$ and $E_2$ share which is $E_1 \cap E_2$. This is to say we may combine these three disjoint pieces to form the union:
\[ E_1 \cup E_2 = (E_1 \cap E_2^c) \cup  (E_2 \cap E_1^c) \cup (E_1 \cap E_2) \]

\noindent Furthermore, since these pieces are disjoint we have the following relationship with their measures:

\begin{equation} 
m(E_1 \cup E_2) = m(E_1 \cap E_2^c) +  m(E_2 \cap E_1^c) + m(E_1 \cap E_2) \label{unionmeasurepieces} 
\end{equation}

We also know that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are measurable, this allows us to form the following two expressions from the definition of measure:

\begin{eqnarray*}
m(E_1) =  m(E_1 \cap E_2) + m(E_1 \cap E_2^c) \implies  m(E_1 \cap E_2^c) =  m(E_1) - m(E_1 \cap E_2) \\
m(E_2) =  m(E_2 \cap E_1) + m(E_2 \cap E_1^c) \implies m(E_2 \cap E_1^c) = m(E_2) - m(E_2 \cap E_1)
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent If we now substitute the above two expressions into $(\ref{unionmeasurepieces})$ we get

\begin{eqnarray*} 
&&m(E_1 \cup E_2)  = m(E_1) - m(E_1 \cap E_2) + m(E_2) - m(E_1 \cap E_2) +  m(E_1 \cap E_2) \\
&\implies& m(E_1 \cup E_2)  = m(E_1) + m(E_2) -  m(E_1 \cap E_2) \\
&\implies& m(E_1 \cup E_2) + m(E_1 \cap E_2)  = m(E_1) + m(E_2) 
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent This completes the proof

Show that the assumption that $m(B_1) < \infty$ is necessary in part (ii) of the theorem regarding continuity of measure.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

If we take $B_k = [k, \infty)$ then it is the case that $B_{k+1} \subset B_k$ for all $k$ but also the case that $m(B_k) = \infty$  for all $k$. 

Since $m(B_k) = \infty$  for all $k$ it is true that $\lim_{n \to \infty} m(B_k) = \infty$.

On the other hand it is clear that $\cap_{n = 1}^\infty B_k = \emptyset$ for suppose $x < \infty$ and $x \in \cap_{n = 1}^\infty B_k$. This implies that $x \in B_k$ for all $k$. This in turn implies that $k < x$ for all $k$ which is only possible in the case that $x = \infty$, this is a contradiction. From this we conclude that $m(\cap_{n = 1}^\infty B_k) = m(\emptyset) = 0$ so that 
\[ m(\cap_{n = 1}^\infty B_k) \neq \lim_{n \to \infty} m(B_k) \]

Let $\{E_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ be a countable disjoint collection of measurable sets. Prove that for any set $A$,
\[ m^*(A \cap \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty m^*(A \cap E_k) \]
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

We start by noting that 
\[  A \cap \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A \cap E_k \]

\noindent By the countable subadditivity of outer measure we have 

\[ m^*(A \cap \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) = m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A \cap E_k) \le  \sum_{k=1}^\infty m^*(A \cap E_k)  \]

If we can now show that $m^*(\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A \cap E_k) \ge  \sum_{k=1}^\infty m^*(A \cap E_k)$ then we are done.

\noindent It is relevant to note that $\cup_{k=1}^n E_k \subset \cup_{k=1}^\infty E_k$ for all $n$. This implies then that $A \cap \bigcup_{k=1}^n E_k \subset A\cap \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k$. By proposition 6, we know that 

\begin{eqnarray*} 
\sum_{k=1}^n m^*(A \cap E_k) &=& m^*(A \cap \bigcup_{k=1}^n E_k) \\
&\le& m^*(A \cap \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) \; \text{by the previous comment and monotonocity} \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Because the right hand side in the above expression is independent of $n$ we may safely take the limit on the left hand side to obtain.
\[ \sum_{k=1}^\infty m^*(A \cap E_k) \le m^*(A \cap \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty E_k) \]

\noindent This completes the proof.

Let $\mathcal{M}'$ be any $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ and $m'$ a set function on $\mathcal{M}'$ which takes values in $[0,\infty]$, is countably additive, and such that $m'(\emptyset) = 0$

\noindent (i)  Show that $m'$ is finitely additive, monotone, countable monotone, and possesses the excision property.

\noindent (ii) Show that $m'$ possesses the same continuity properties as Lebesgue measure.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

For part (i) we need to show that $m'$ as defined above is finitely additive, monotone, countable monotone, and possesses the excision property.
We start with finite additivity. This is straightforward because we are given that $m'$ is countably additive. So, if $E_1, E_2, ...$ are disjoint then we are given that 
\[ m'(\cup_{n = 1}^\infty E_k) = \sum_{n =1}^\infty m'(E_k) \]
If we take $E_k = \emptyset$ for $k > n$ and use the fact that $m'(\emptyset) = 0$ then we derive
\[ m'(\cup_{n = 1}^n E_k) = \sum_{n =1}^n m'(E_k) \]
which shows the finite additivity.

Monotonocity can be shown by supposing $A \subset B$. We note that $A$ and $B \sim A$ are disjoint. Since $A \subset B$ we know that $A \cup (B \sim A) = B$. From finite additivity and the fact that $A$ and $B \sim A$ are disjoint we derive:
\[ m'(B) = m'(A \cup (B \sim A)) = m'(A) + m'(B \sim A) \ge m'(A) \]
which demonstrates monotonocity.

There are two ways to show countable monotonocity. We will show both ways as an exercise. Both proofs depend on the observation that if $\{ E_k \}_{k = 1}^\infty$ covers $E$ then
\[ E \subset \cup_{k = 1}^\infty E_k \implies m'(E) \le m'(\cup_{k = 1}^\infty E_k) \]
So each of the two proofs will show that $m'(\cup_{k = 1}^\infty E_k) \le \sum_{k = 1}^\infty m'(E_k)$ which establishes the result. \\

For the first method we note that clearly $B \sim A \subset B$ which implies $m'(B \sim A) \le m'(B)$. We now define $B_1 = E_1$ and $B_k  = E_k \sim (\cup_{i = 1}^{k - 1} E_i)$ which has the following properties
\[ B_i \cap B_j = \emptyset, \quad \cup_{k = 1}^\infty E_k = \cup_{k = 1}^\infty B_k  \]
Through the relationship that $m'(B \sim A) \le m'(B)$ we have that $m'(B_k) = m'(E_k \sim (\cup_{i = 1}^{k - 1} E_i)) \le m'(E_k)$.

Because the $B_k$ are disjoint we may complete the first proof as follows
\[ m'(\cup_{k = 1}^\infty E_k ) = m'(\cup_{k = 1}^\infty B_k ) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty m'(B_k) \le  \sum_{k = 1}^\infty m'(E_k) \]

\noindent The second method starts with the observation that 
\[ A \cup B = A \cup (B \sim A) \implies m'(A \cup B) = m'(A) + m'(B \sim A) \le m'(A) + m'(B) \]

\noindent A simple inductive argument shows that for and $n$ we have
\[ m'(\cup_{k = 1}^n E_k) = \sum_{k = 1}^n m'(E_k) \]

\noindent Since $m'(A) \ge 0$ for all $A$ we know that $\sum_{k = 1}^n m'(E_k) \le \sum_{k = 1}^\infty m'(E_k)$ for all $n$. This brings us to the following relationship
\[ m'(\cup_{k = 1}^n E_k) \le \sum_{k = 1}^\infty m'(E_k) \]

Since the left hand side is independent of $n$ we may let $n$ go to $\infty$ to get the relationship we sought to prove which is

\[ m'(\cup_{k = 1}^\infty E_k) \le \sum_{k = 1}^\infty m'(E_k) \]

The final piece of part $(i)$ is to show the excision property. This is also straight forward, if we note that $A \subset B$ means that $B = A \cup B \sim A$. Since are disjoint we may derive the excision property using finite additivity and assuming that $m'(A) < \infty$:
\[ m'(B) = m'(A \cup (B \sim A)) = m'(A) + m'(B \sim A) \implies m'(B) - m'(A) = m'(B \sim A) \]

For part (ii) we only need to note that the proof of the continuity of measure only depend on countable additivity, the excision property and the given fact that $m(\emptyset)  = 0$. Since all these properties are either assumed or proved from the given properties of $m'$ the proof of the continuity of measure carries over to $m'$ with out modification.

Show that continuity of measure together with finite additivity of measure implies countable additivity of measure.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}
	
We are given a disjoint collection of sets $\{ E_k \}_{k=1}^\infty$, we start by defining $A_k = \cup_{j = 1}^k E_j$ so that \\$A_k \subset A_{k + 1}$ for all $k$. 
It is clear that $\cup_{k = 1}^\infty A_k = \cup_{k = 1}^\infty \cup_{j = 1}^k E_j = \cup_{j = 1}^\infty E_j$ since $E_j$ is in both $\cup_{k = 1}^\infty \cup_{j = 1}^k E_j$ and  $\cup_{j = 1}^\infty E_j$ for all $j$.

The following calculation completes the result
\begin{eqnarray*}
m(\cup_{j = 1}^\infty E_j) = m(\cup_{k =1}^\infty \cup_{j = 1}^k E_j) &=& m(\cup_{k = 1}^\infty A_k) \\
&=& \lim_{k \to \infty } m(A_k) \quad \text{by continuity of measure} \\
&=& \lim_{k \to \infty } m(\cup_{j = 1}^k E_j) \\
&=& \lim_{k \to \infty } \sum_{j = 1}^k m(E_j) \quad \text{by finite additivity} \\
&=& \sum_{j = 1}^\infty m(E_j) \\

(ii) Explicitly find a choice set for the rational equivalence relation on any set.\\
(iii) Define two numbers to irrationally equivalent provided their difference is irrational. Is this an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}$? Is this an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{Q}$?
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

\noindent For part (i) we need to verify reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity. 

For reflexivity we note that for each $x \in E$ it is true that $x - x = 0 \in \mathbb{Q}$. This shows that the rational equivalence is reflexive. 

\noindent Symmetry goes as follows. If we have $x, y \in E$ and we know that $x - y = q \in \mathbb{Q}$ by assumption then we also know that $y - x = -q \in \mathbb{Q}$ which shows the symmetry of the rational equivalence. 

\noindent Finally for transitivity we suppose that $x, y, z \in E$ and $x - y = r \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $y - z = q \in \mathbb{Q}$. We can add the previous two expression to get $(x - y) + (y - z) = x - z = r + q \in \mathbb{Q}$ which shows the rational equivalence holds for $x$ and $z$ if holds for $x, y$ and $y, z$. 

In part (ii) we need to find a choice set for a given set. An easy but somewhat trivial example starts with the set $S = [0,1] \cap \mathbb{Q}$ the rationals between 0 and 1 inclusive. The choice set will only contain one because from this one point every other point in the set differs by a rational. This is to say that every point in the set $S$ is in the same equivalence relation. We may therefore pick any point in $S$ to represent the choice set so we take $\mathcal{C}_S = \{ \frac{1}{2} \}$

Part (iii) we can show that the irrational equivalence is not a equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}$ by showing that it must fail to be reflexive. For any value $x \in \mathbb{R}$ we note that $x - x = 0 \in \mathbb{Q}$. So the irrational equivalence fails to be reflexive. This also true for $\mathbb{Q}$ since again if $x \in \mathbb{Q}$ we know that $x - x = 0 \in \mathbb{Q}$ which again shows that irrational equivalence is not an equivalence relation.

Show that any choice set for the rational equivalence relation on a set of positive outer measure must be uncountably infinite.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

We assume that the choice set $\mathcal{C}_E$ is countable and derive a contradiction. For each $c_i \in \mathcal{C}_E$ let $B_i = \{ c_i + q \; | \;\text{ where } q \in \mathbb{Q} \}$ and $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Since the rationals are countable the set $B_i$ is countable for each $i \in \mathbb{N}$. Since there are countable number of $c_i \in \mathcal{C}_E$ we have a countable collection countable sets so the union $\cup{i = 1}^\infty B_i$ is countable which also means $m(\cup_{i = 1}^\infty B_i) = 0$. By the second property of choice sets for any $x \in E$ we have $x = c_i + q$ where $c_i, q \in B_i$ so $x \in B_i$. This is to say that $E \subset \cup_{i = 1}^\infty B_i$. By monotonocity we have
\[ m(E) \le m(\cup_{i =1}^\infty B_i) = 0 \implies m(E) = 0 \]
This is a contradiction because we started with the assumption that the measure $E$ was positive, this completes the proof.

Justify the assertion in the proof of Vitali's Theorem that it suffices to consider the case that $E$ is bounded.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

Let $I_k = [k, k + 1]$ for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers, positive, negative and zero) and let $E_k = I_k \cap E$. We must then have 
\[ E = \cup_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} E_k \]

\noindent Since the $E_k$ are disjoint we may use countable additivity to show
\[ m(E) = m(\cup_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} E_k) = \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}} m(E_k)\]

We have that $m(E) > 0$ from Vitali's theorem. The above expression shows that it is not the case that $m(E_k) = 0$ for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ otherwise the above expression gives a contradiction. This shows that at least one $E_k$ has positive measure so even if $E$ is unbounded it has bounded subset of positive measure. The nonmeasureable subset of the bounded set $E_k$ is also a subset of the unbounded set $E$ so we only need to prove the bounded case as is done in the proof of Vitali's set.

Does Lemma 16 remain true if $\Lambda$ is allowed to be finite or to be uncountably infinite? Does it remain true if $\Lambda$ is allowed to be unbounded.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

The proof of Lemma 16 depends on $\Lambda$ only so that we can deduce that $ m \left[ \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} (\lambda + E) \right]$ is finite. This is clearly still the case if $\Lambda$ is finite where we are assuming as in the proof that $E$ is bounded. Lemma 16 is false if we allow $\Lambda$ to be uncountable even while it remains bounded.

If we allow $E = \{ 0, 1 \}$ and take $\Lambda = [0, 1)$ then for each $\lambda \in [0, 1)$ the set $E_\lambda = \{0 + \lambda, 1 + \lambda \}$ is disjoint from any other set $E_{\lambda'}$ where $\lambda' \in [0, 1)$. These sets satisfy the hypotheses of Lemma 16 except that $\Lambda$ is uncountable. We see that the theorem fails to be true because 
\[ m \left[ \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} (\lambda + E) \right] = m([0, 2)) = 2 \neq 0\]

Lemma 16 also fails if we allow $\Lambda$ to be unbounded. Let $E = [0, \frac{1}{2}]$ and $\Lambda = \{0,1,2,\cdots \}$. The set of translates of $E$ comes out to be $\{ [0,\frac{1}{2}], [1, \frac{3}{2}], [2, \frac{5}{2}], \cdots  \}$ however this gives the following result
\[  m \left[ \cup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} (\lambda + E) \right]  = m \left[ \bigcup_{k = 0}^\infty [k, k + \frac{1}{2}] \right] =  \sum_{k = 0}^\infty m([k, k + \frac{1}{2}]) = \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{2} = \infty \]
this shows again that Lemma 16 fails.

First we find a set $G \in G_\delta$ that is such that $m^*(E) = m^*(G)$. By the definition of outer measure we know that for each $\frac{1}{j}$ there is collection of intervals $\{ I_{jk} \} _{ k = 1}^\infty$ (which we choose to be open) which cover $E$ and are such that 
\[ \sum_{k=1}^\infty \ell(I_{jk}) \le m^*(E) + \frac{1}{j} \]

\noindent If we let $G_j = \cup_{k = 1}^\infty I_{jk}$ then $E \subset G_j$ and we have 
\[ 0 \le m^*(G_j) \le \sum_{k=1}^\infty \ell(I_{jk}) \le m^*(E) + \frac{1}{j} \implies 0 \le m^*(G_j) - m^*(E) \le \frac{1}{j} \]

\noindent We now let $G = \cap_{k = 1}^\infty G_k$, from the above expression we get that $m^*(G) = m^*(E)$. Since $E \subset G_j$ for all $j$ we also have that $E \subset G$.

To complete the proof we note that $E \subset G$ implies that $G = (G \sim E) \cup E$. By the countable subadditivity of outer measure we get 
\[ m^*(G) \le m^*(G \sim E) + m^*(E) \implies m^*(G) - m^*(E) \le m^*(G \sim E) \; \text{since $m^*(E)$ is finite} \]
\noindent So
\[ 0 \le m^*(G \sim E) \; \text{since} \; m^*(G) = m^*(E) \]
There are two possibilities, either $0 = m^*(G \sim E)$ or $0 < m^*(G \sim E)$. If we have $0 = m^*(G \sim E)$ then Theorem 11 part $(ii)$ implies that $E$ is measurable which contradicts the hypothesis that it is not. This only leaves the second possibility that $0 < m^*(G \sim E)$, this completes the proof.

Show that there is a continuous, strictly increasing function on the interval $[0,1]$ that maps a set of positive measure onto a set of measure zero.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

The strictly increasing function $\psi$ defined to be $\psi(x) = \phi(x) + x$, with $\phi$ being the Cantor-Lebesgue function, maps the Cantor set $C$ onto a subset of $[0,2]$. This subset $A \subset [0,2]$ has a positive measure. Since the inverse of strictly increasing function is strictly increasing we get the function $\psi^{-1}: A \subset [0,2] \to C$ which maps a set of positive measure $A$ to $C$ which has measure zero.

Let $f$ be the function $f = 2 x$. The domain of $f$ will be $f^{-1}(A) \subset [0,1]$ where $f^{-1}$ exists since $f$ is strictly increasing over any domain. Since the composition of strictly increasing functions is strictly increasing then the function $\psi^{-1} \circ f : f^{-1}(A) \to C$ is strictly increasing and maps the set $f^{-1}(A) \subset [0,1]$ which has positive measure to $C$ which is measure zero.

Let $f$ be an increasing function on the open interval $I$. For $x_0 \in I$ show that $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ if and only if there are sequences $\{ a_n \}$ and $\{ b_n \}$ in $I$ such that for each $n, a_n < x_0 < b_n$,  and $\lim_{n \to \infty} [f(b_n) - f(a_n)] = 0$.
\\\\ \emph{Proof.}

Proving the $if$ direction first, we assume that $f$ is continuous. Because $x_0 \in I$ and $I$ is open there exists an $N$ such that for $j > N$ we have $x_0 - \frac{1}{j} \in I$. Similarly there is also a $N'$ such that for $j > N'$ we have $x_0 + \frac{1}{j} \in I$. Now let $M = $ Max $\{N, N'\}$ and we define 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\{ a_n \}_{n = 1}^\infty = \{ x_0 - \frac{1}{M+1}, x_0 - \frac{1}{M+2}, x_0 - \frac{1}{M+3}, \cdots \} \\  
\{ b_n \}_{n = 1}^\infty = \{ x_0 + \frac{1}{M+1}, x_0 + \frac{1}{M+2}, x_0 + \frac{1}{M+3}, \cdots \}
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent From these definitions it is clear that $a_n$ and $b_n$ are sequences in $I$ such that $a_n < x_0 < b_n$ for all $n$. By the continuity of $f$ we know that since $\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = x_0$ that $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n) = f(x_0)$ and similarly for $b_n$ that $\lim_{n \to \infty} b_n = x_0$ implies $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n) = f(x_0)$. Together these expressions say $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n) - f(x_0) = 0$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n) - f(x_0) = 0$ which allows us to complete the first part of the proof by calculating
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n) - f(a_n) &=& \lim_{n \to \infty} (f(b_n) - f(x_0) + f(x_0) - f(a_n)) \\
&=& \lim_{n \to \infty} (f(b_n) - f(x_0)) +   \lim_{n \to \infty} (f(x_0) - f(a_n)) \\
&=& 0 + 0 = 0
\end{eqnarray*}

We now prove the 'only if' direction which is to say that we assume there exists sequences $\{a_n\}$ and $\{ b_n \}$ where $a_n < x_0 < b_n$ for all $n$ and $\lim_{n \to \infty} [f(b_n) - f(a_n)] = 0$. To prove continuity we would like to show that for any sequence $\{ x_n \}$ such that $\lim_{n \to \infty} x_n = x_0$ we have $\lim_{n \to \infty} f(x_n) = f(x_0)$.

For every $n$ there exists a $M$ which depends on $n$ such that for all $m > M$ we have 

\[ a_n < x_m < b_n \quad \text{for $m > M$} \]

We note that since $m \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$ we can replace $\lim_{m \to \infty}$ with $\lim_{n \to \infty}$ and generally rename $m$ to $n$ in limits since it will then be acting as a dummy variable.
\noindent We may then perform the following calculation
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_n < x_m < b_n  &\implies& f(a_n) < f( x_m) < f(b_n) \quad \text{since $f$ is increasing} \\
&\implies&   \lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_m) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n)  \\
&\implies&   \lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_n) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n)  \quad \text{by renaming dummy variables in limits} \\
&\implies&  0 \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_n) - f(a_n) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n) - f(a_n) \\ 
&\implies&  0 \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_n) - f(a_n) \le  0 \implies \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_n) - f(a_n) = 0 \implies \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n)  \\ 
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent We may perform the same calculation with the original expression $a_n < x_0 < b_n $ to get 
\begin{eqnarray*}
a_n < x_0 < b_n  &\implies& f(a_n) < f( x_0) < f(b_n) \quad \text{since $f$ is increasing} \\
&\implies&   \lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_0) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n)  \\
&\implies&  0 \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_0) - f(a_n) \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f(b_n) - f(a_n) \\ 
&\implies&  0 \le  \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_0) - f(a_n) \le  0 \implies \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_0) - f(a_n) = 0 \implies \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_0) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n)  \\ 
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent This allows us to complete the proof since we have shown
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_n) =  \lim_{n \to \infty} f(a_n)  = \lim_{n \to \infty} f( x_0) \]
